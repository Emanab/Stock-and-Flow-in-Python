# Stock and Flow Canvas

## Introduction

This is a python realization of Stock and Flow Diagram display, based on ***Tkinter***.
The intention is to allow users to visually view the model.
Here you can have a quick glance of it:

## How to use

Stock and flow diagrams created by Stella can be displayed using this software.
No additional package other than ***Python3*** is needed.
The program could be run from terminal, powershell, or CMD by executing:

```
python3 main.py
```

Then you can load the model in the graphic interface.
